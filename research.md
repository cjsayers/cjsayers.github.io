## Ultrafast studies of charge density waves

Using intense ultrashort laser pulses, it's possible to induce phase transtions in strongly-correlated materials by destroying forms of electronic and lattice order. Ultrafast spectroscopy techniques allow us to monitor this process in real time, and can help us understand more about the driving mechanism responsible for various phases of matter. For this work, I use a combination of time-resolved optical and photoemission spectoscopy techniques (TR-ARPES).

## Electronic structure of 2D materials

The electronic structure of materials dictates many of their chemical, electrical and optical properties. In order to directly visualise this structure, I use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique relies on Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect, whereby electrons are emitted from a sample surface when irradiated with light of sufficient energy. By measuring both the kinetic energy and angle of the emitted electrons, we can reconstruct the internal electronic structure.

## Single crystal growth of TMDs

I use chemical vapour transport (CVT) techniques to grow ultra-high quality single crystals, from semiconductors to superconductors.
