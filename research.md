## Ultrafast studies of charge density waves

Using intense ultrashort laser pulses, it's possible to induce phase transtions in strongly correlated materials by destroying forms of electronic and lattice order. Ultrafast spectroscopy technqiues allow us to monitor this process in real time, and can help us understand more about the driving mechanism responsible for various phases of matter. For this work, I use a combination of time-resolved optical spectroscopy and photoemission spectoscopy techniques (TR-ARPES).

## Single crystal growth of TMDs

I use chemical vapour transport (CVT) techniques to grow ultra-high quality single crystals, from semiconductors to superconductors.
