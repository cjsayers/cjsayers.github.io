I am currently Research fellow in the [Ultrafast Spectroscopy group](https://www.femtosecond.fisi.polimi.it/) at Politecnico di Milano where use ultrafast optical spectroscopy to investigate the electron and phonon dynamics of 2D materials and their heterostructures.

My doctoral thesis focuses on understanding phase transitions in layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials are well known to exhibit strongly-correlated effects such as superconductivity, charge density waves (CDWs) and Mott insulating behaviour, which are often dictated by their electronic structure. For this work, I used a combination of time-resolved spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) techniques.
