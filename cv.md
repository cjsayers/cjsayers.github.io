My doctoral thesis focuses on understanding phase transitions in layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials are well known to exhibit strongly-correlated effects such as superconductivity, charge density waves (CDWs) and Mott insulating behaviour, which are often dictated by their electronic structure. For this work, I used a combination of time-resolved spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) techniques.
